- Returns a list of duplicates instaed of just handling the first duplicate.

## How much of the game was realised, and how much has been verified?
The game was fully realized using the requirements given. All commands have been implemented, verified and error handled. If the user inputs an invalid command, then the invalid command line will print. Most of the implementation has also been specified with pre/post conditions along with invariants where loops are present.

## Which parts of the game was verified
#### Common.dfy
The verification approach started from the root functions. All functions which have been used in Common.dfy have either pre-conditions and/or post-conditions to ensure their correctness.

#### Commands.dfy
Commands.dfy have their methods with specifications added. The process and fromString method have not been verified as I was unsure how to handle it, and was confident that verification of the respective process command methods and the Common.dfy methods they each use was sufficient verification. Each command's process method contains verification such as argument lengths and ensuring they return the right type. This was to make it easier to know if a command is invalid since any command which does not adhere to the specification would return Nothing and can be handled with an Invalid Command statement as seen in Main.dfy.

#### Main.dfy
